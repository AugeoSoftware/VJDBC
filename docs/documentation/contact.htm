<p class="textfont">I'm a member of the <a href="http://www.simplicit.de" target="_blank">simplic.IT</a> 
  group. After getting our feet wet sometimes with complex specifications like 
  J2EE we try to figure out simpler and more pragmatic approaches in the big ocean 
  of opensource projects. We believe that opensource adds much value to software 
  development and we want to give something back to the community.</p>

  Michael Link is a member of the simplic.IT group. After getting our feet wet sometimes with complex specifications like J2EE we try to figure out simpler and more pragmatic approaches in the big ocean of opensource projects. We believe that opensource adds much value to software development and we want to give something back to the community.

  Hunter Payne is a Distributed System Architect with SQLStream, Inc which is part of the Eigenbase Project which is responsible for several large OpenSource Database projects including Farrago and Fennel.

  If you have any questions, suggestions, feature requests etc. please go to the VJDBC-SourceForge-Site and ask them there.
